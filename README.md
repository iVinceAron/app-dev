# My Favorite Movie: *The Platform*

## Plot Summary
- *The Platform* is a Spanish social science fiction horror film that explores a vertical prison system. Each level contains a platform with food that descends through the levels, stopping for a limited time, allowing prisoners on each level to eat as much as they want â€” but only what the previous levels have left behind.

## Key Characters
- **Goreng**: The protagonist who enters the prison voluntarily and tries to understand the system.
- **Trimagasi**: Goreng's cellmate on Level 48, who has a unique perspective on survival.
- **Imoguiri**: A former prison administrator who enters the system to make a difference.

### Why I Love It
> I love *The Platform* because of its unique concept. The movie cleverly uses a dystopian prison setting to emphasize the true nature of human behavior when resources are scarce, and survival instincts are tested. It explores the lengths people will go to for survival and how power and privilege can shape our actions and ethics. The intense atmosphere and layered symbolism in the film left me thinking long after it ended, making it a movie that resonates deeply with themes of inequality and moral choices.

### Fun Facts

- The movie premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) and won the People's Choice Award for Midnight Madness.
- It explores themes of social inequality, survival, and morality.
